**DSA (DataStructures&Algorithms)**
===
This repo has to be intended as a university project for the "DataStructures and Algorithms" class @ DIB. Every code or project inside is made for educational purposes.

You are **free** to use it as you like ( see [license file](LICENSE)).</br>
But if you are looking for powerful and strong algorithms, I'd advise you boost or STD library.
